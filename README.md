# Numerical Modeling of Thermal Flows in Entrance Channels for Polymer Extrusion: A Parametric Study

Attached pdf file is the published journal paper. This work presents the methodology to find the optimal dimensions of extrusion die parts (inlet and pre-land parts). 
Numerical computations were done by using the finite difference and finite element methods. 
These methods were implemented in Python to compute the temperature distrubutions of some polypropylene melt flow in parallel-plate and circular tube. 

Python codes are in two separate .py files: 
one for finite difference scheme used in parallel-plate flow simulation, another one is for finite element scheme used in circular tube flow simulation.
